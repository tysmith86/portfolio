    <h2>About Tyler</h2>
    <p>I have always been passionate about technology. I started building computers in my early teens, and even created my first webpage using html when I was 12. I was the kid who had boxes full of parts to various pieces of tech...unfortunately at that age I was better at taking things apart than I was putting them back together.</p>
