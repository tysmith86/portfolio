    <p>Hello, My name is Tyler Smith. I completed the Full-Stack JavaScript course at Code Fellows PDX in January of 2017. Before Code Fellows, I worked at Northwest Telecom Systems as the Lead Telecom Technician. I decided to pursue a career in software development because it is where my deep passion for technology and creativity meet.</p>
